## 🔴 CRITICAL - Do These NOW! (Week 1)

### 1. Google Business Profile (HIGHEST PRIORITY!)
**Timeline: Day 1-3**
```
□ Create account: https://business.google.com
□ Add business details
□ Verify business (postcard/phone)
□ Upload 10+ photos of products
□ Set business hours
□ Write optimized description
□ Add services & attributes
□ Enable messaging
```

**Why Critical**: 46% of all Google searches are local. Without Google Business Profile, you're invisible for "sweet shop near me" searches.

### 2. Get First 10 Google Reviews
**Timeline: Day 3-7**
```
□ Ask 10 happy customers for reviews
□ Send review link via WhatsApp/Email
□ Offer 10% discount for reviews
□ Respond to every review
□ Target: 5-star rating
```

**Why Critical**: Reviews are #1 ranking factor for local SEO. Businesses with 10+ reviews rank 54% higher.

### 3. Submit to Google Search Console
**Timeline: Day 1**
```
□ Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
□ Add property: https://sweethome-store.com
□ Verify ownership (HTML file method)
□ Submit sitemap: https://sweethome-store.com/sitemap.xml
□ Request indexing for homepage
□ Check for errors weekly
```

**Why Critical**: Google can't rank what it doesn't know exists. This tells Google to crawl your site.

### 4. Submit to Bing Webmaster
**Timeline: Day 2**
```
□ Go to: https://www.bing.com/webmasters
□ Import from Google Search Console
□ Submit sitemap
```
